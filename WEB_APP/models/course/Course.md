## This code defines three Mongoose Schemas for a course management application:

# Course Schema:

- title (String, required): The title of the course (length 3-255 characters).
description (String, required): A detailed description of the course (length 3-1100 characters).
- rootFolder (ObjectId, required, ref: 'Folder'): A reference to the root folder containing the course materials.
- state (String, required, enum: ['Pending', 'Posted', 'OutDated']): The current state of the course (Pending, Posted, or Outdated).
- tags (Array of ObjectIds, optional): An array of ObjectIds referencing associated tags.
- picture (Buffer, optional): A buffer containing the course image data (optional).
- owner (ObjectId, ref:"Teacher"): Reference to the teacher who owns the course.
- authors (Array of ObjectIds, ref:"Teacher"): An array of ObjectIds referencing the course authors (teachers).
- price (ObjectId, optional, ref: "Price"): Reference to a pricing document (optional).
- chat (ObjectId, optional, ref: "Chat"): Reference to a chat room associated with the course (optional).
# Document Schema:

- name (String, required): The name of the document.
- type (String): The type of document (text, image, video, etc.).
- parent (ObjectId, required, ref: "Folder"): A reference to the parent folder containing the document.
- sections (Array of ObjectIds, ref: "Section"): An array of ObjectIds referencing sections within the document.
# Folder Schema:

- name (String): The name of the folder. (Uniqueness is not enforced)
- type (String): The type of folder (course root, subfolder, etc.).
- parent (ObjectId, optional, ref: "Folder"): A reference to the parent folder for nested structures.
- subdirs (Array of ObjectIds, ref: "Folder"): An array of ObjectIds referencing subfolders within the current folder.
- documents (Array of ObjectIds, ref: "Document"): An array of ObjectIds referencing documents within the current folder.
- order (Array of Strings): An array of strings (potentially document or folder IDs) defining the order of content displayed within the folder.
# Relationships:

- A Course has a one-to-one relationship with a Folder through the rootFolder field.
- A Folder can have a one-to-many relationship with other Folders through the parent and subdirs fields.
- A Folder can have a one-to-many relationship with Documents through the documents field.
- A Document has a one-to-many relationship with Sections through the sections field.

# Section

- name (String, required): The name of the section (length 1-255 characters).
- type (String, required, enum: ["Text", "Video", "Image"]): Specifies the type of content within the section (text, video, or image).
- document (ObjectId, required, ref: "Document"): A reference to the document containing the section.
- content (String, required conditionally): The text content of the section (required only for "Text" type).
- address (String, required conditionally): The URL or path to the video/image file (required only for "Video" or "Image" types).
# Validation:

The schema uses conditional validation for the content and address fields. They are only required when the type field matches their respective category ("Text" for content, "Video" or "Image" for address). This ensures data integrity and prevents storing unnecessary information for different section types.

# Relationships:

A Section has a one-to-many relationship with a Document through the document field.
